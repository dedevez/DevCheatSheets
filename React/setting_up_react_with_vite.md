### **Dev Cheat Sheet: Setting Up a React Frontend with Vite**

This cheat sheet provides a step-by-step guide to set up a **React frontend using Vite**, with added commentary to explain what’s being done and why.

---

## **1. Prerequisites**
### **Install Node.js**
- Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript outside of the browser. It's required to manage dependencies and run the Vite development server.
- **Verify Installation**:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
- If you’re managing multiple projects, consider using `nvm` (Node Version Manager) to switch between Node.js versions:
   ```bash
   nvm install 16
   nvm use 16
   ```

---

## **2. Create a New Vite Project**
1. **Initialize the Project**:
   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest my-react-app -- --template react
   ```
   - This command scaffolds a new React project using Vite as the build tool. The `--template react` flag sets up the project pre-configured with React.
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd my-react-app
   ```

   - **Commentary**: This folder will contain your entire React application, including source files, dependencies, and configuration.

---

## **3. Install Project Dependencies**
1. Install Node modules:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   - Dependencies listed in `package.json` are downloaded and stored in the `node_modules` folder. These include React and Vite's libraries needed for your app to function.
2. Optional: Use `yarn` as an alternative to npm for faster dependency management:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

---

## **4. Run the Development Server**
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - This starts a local server powered by Vite. It allows you to view your application in the browser and automatically refreshes the page whenever you make changes to your code.
2. Open your browser and navigate to the provided URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
   - **Commentary**: The URL is your live preview environment, where you can test your changes in real-time.

---

## **5. Add React Bootstrap**
1. Install React Bootstrap:
   ```bash
   npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
   ```
   - React Bootstrap is a library of prebuilt UI components styled with Bootstrap. It makes building consistent, responsive UIs much easier and faster.
2. Import Bootstrap styles in `src/main.jsx`:
   ```javascript
   import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
   ```
   - **Commentary**: This ensures that Bootstrap's default styles are available globally across your application.

---

## **6. Create a Basic Component**
1. Edit `src/App.jsx` to include a simple React Bootstrap layout:
   ```jsx
   import React from 'react';
   import { Button, Container, Navbar } from 'react-bootstrap';

   function App() {
       return (
           <>
               <Navbar bg="dark" variant="dark">
                   <Container>
                       <Navbar.Brand href="#home">My Vite App</Navbar.Brand>
                   </Container>
               </Navbar>
               <Container className="mt-4">
                   <h1>Welcome to My Vite App</h1>
                   <Button variant="primary">Click Me!</Button>
               </Container>
           </>
       );
   }

   export default App;
   ```
   - This creates a reusable React component, which is the building block of React apps. The layout includes a styled navigation bar and a button, showcasing React Bootstrap's functionality.

2. Save the file and verify the changes in the browser.
   - **Commentary**: Changes should instantly reflect in the browser due to Vite’s fast refresh.

---

## **7. Set Up Routing with React Router**
1. Install React Router:
   ```bash
   npm install react-router-dom
   ```
   - React Router allows you to define navigation paths within your app. This is essential for building multi-page applications without full-page reloads.

2. Update `src/main.jsx` to enable routing:
   ```javascript
   import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
   import React from 'react';
   import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
   import App from './App';
   import './index.css';

   ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
       <React.StrictMode>
           <BrowserRouter>
               <App />
           </BrowserRouter>
       </React.StrictMode>
   );
   ```
   - Wrapping the app in `BrowserRouter` enables routing capabilities throughout your application.

3. Add routes in `src/App.jsx`:
   ```jsx
   import { Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
   import { Navbar, Container, Nav } from 'react-bootstrap';

   function Home() {
       return <h1>Home Page</h1>;
   }

   function About() {
       return <h1>About Page</h1>;
   }

   function App() {
       return (
           <>
               <Navbar bg="dark" variant="dark">
                   <Container>
                       <Navbar.Brand href="/">My Vite App</Navbar.Brand>
                       <Nav>
                           <Nav.Link as={Link} to="/">Home</Nav.Link>
                           <Nav.Link as={Link} to="/about">About</Nav.Link>
                       </Nav>
                   </Container>
               </Navbar>
               <Container className="mt-4">
                   <Routes>
                       <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
                       <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
                   </Routes>
               </Container>
           </>
       );
   }

   export default App;
   ```
   - **Commentary**: Routing enables navigation between pages (`/` and `/about`) without refreshing the page, enhancing the user experience.

## **8. Prepare for CI/CD**
1. **What & Why**:
   - A CI/CD pipeline automates the building, testing, and deployment of your app. Start planning the pipeline early to avoid manual repetitive tasks.
2. **Start with GitHub Actions**:
   - Set up a `.github/workflows` directory for defining CI workflows.
3. **Containerize the App with Docker**:
   - Use Docker to package your app, ensuring consistent environments across development and production.
4. **Plan Deployment**:
   - Choose a hosting platform like DigitalOcean, Netlify, or Vercel for deploying your app.

---

## **9. Build for Production**
1. Run the build command:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   - This generates a production-ready version of your app in the `dist` folder, optimized for performance.
2. Preview the production build:
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```
   - **Commentary**: This is useful for testing the production build locally before deploying it to a live server.

---

## **10. Tips and Tricks**
### **General Development Tips**
- Use `ESLint` and `Prettier` for code quality and formatting:
   ```bash
   npm install -D eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-react
   ```
- Leverage `.env` files for managing environment-specific configurations.

### **Debugging**
- Use **React Developer Tools** for debugging React components.
- Check browser dev tools for network requests and console errors.

### **Optimizing Performance**
- Use **React.lazy** and **Suspense** to load components on-demand.
- Optimize assets (e.g., images and CSS) for faster load times.

---

## **11. References for CI/CD**
- **GitHub Actions**:
   - Automate your testing, builds, and deployments.
- **Docker**:
   - Create a `Dockerfile` for consistent environments.
- **DigitalOcean**:
   - Use a droplet or App Platform for hosting.
